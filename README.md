Markov Chain Simulation of Polypeptide Folding Mechanics
This Python Notebook contains and executes the functions to create and simulate simple chains of amino acids (polypeptides). These can be simulated using Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo Methods. If interested, I will share my thesis containing derivations of the equations used and analysis of the results.
